//! Shared state between the chromium capture backend and the autoplay
//! manager.
//!
//! - `page`: the [`GamePage`] handle for the tab where Majsoul (or another
//!   supported platform) is loaded. Written by `src/capture/chromium/cdp.rs`
//!   (or `capture::webkit` on Linux) when it observes a WebSocket whose URL
//!   host matches a known platform. The handle tracks the **tab**, not the
//!   WebSocket: it survives the many short-lived Route-probe / lobby-
//!   reconnect sockets Majsoul opens and closes during a game, and is
//!   cleared only when its owning tab is removed from the page snapshot.
//!   Read by `AutoplayManager` whenever it needs to dispatch input.
//! - `canvas_rect`: cached `getBoundingClientRect()` of the game canvas,
//!   used to translate 16:9-normalised coordinates into CSS pixels.
//!   Filled lazily by the autoplay manager (one `Runtime.evaluate` per
//!   refresh) and invalidated on round transitions.
//! - `resize`: counts window resizes of the game tab, so a rect measured
//!   before one is re-measured before the next click (see
//!   `autoplay::resize`).
//!
//! Both fields are populated only when the chromium capture backend is
//! active. The MITM backend leaves the context untouched, so reads return
//! `None` and the manager skips the click.
